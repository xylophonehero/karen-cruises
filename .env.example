# Cruise Schedule Data Files Configuration
#
# REQUIRED: Specify which schedule JSON file to use.
# Schedule files should follow the format: schedule-XXX.json (e.g., schedule-karen.json)
# Files should be placed in the src/data folder.
# Paths are relative to src/data directory.
#
# Examples:
#   VITE_SCHEDULES_FILE=schedule-karen.json
#   VITE_SCHEDULES_FILE=schedule-john.json
#   VITE_SCHEDULES_FILE=data/schedule-karen.json
#
# Note:
# - This environment variable is REQUIRED - the build will fail if not set
# - Environment variables are resolved at BUILD TIME
# - You must rebuild the app after changing this value
# - Only the specified schedule file will be bundled (not all JSON files)
# - Itineraries are always loaded from the static file: itineraries.json

# Path to the schedules JSON file (relative to src/data)
# REQUIRED: This must be set or the build will fail
# Example: schedule-karen.json (file should be at src/data/schedule-karen.json)
VITE_SCHEDULES_FILE=schedule-karen.json
